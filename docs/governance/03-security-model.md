# Security Model

> 🔗 **Related**: See [Governance Model](02-governance-model.md) for governance security measures.

## Overview

PHEME Protocol implements a comprehensive security model to protect the protocol, its users, and their assets through multiple layers of safeguards and controls.

### Core Principles

* Defense in depth
* Least privilege access
* Transparent operations
* Regular audits
* Community oversight

> 🛡️ **Protection**: Review [Technical Security](../technical/05-security.md) for implementation details.

## Smart Contract Security

### Contract Architecture

```mermaid

    A[Proxy Admin] --> B[Implementation]
    B --> C[Governor]
    B --> D[Timelock]
    B --> E[Treasury]
    C --> F[Execution]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

### Security Features

1. **Upgradability**
   * Transparent proxy pattern
   * Timelock delays
   * Multi-sig control
   * Emergency pause
2. **Access Control**
   * Role-based permissions
   * Function modifiers
   * Guard checks
   * Event logging
3. **Value Protection**
   * Reentrancy guards
   * Integer overflow checks
   * Balance validations
   * Transfer limits

> ⚙️ **Technical**: See [Smart Contracts](../developer-guide/01-smart-contracts.md) for implementation.

## Governance Security

### Proposal Protection

* Minimum token requirement (TBD)
* Review period
* Timelock delay (48h)
* Emergency cancellation
* Multi-sig oversight

### Voting Security

```typescript
interface VotingSecurity {
    quorum: "4% of total power",
    delay: "1 block",
    period: "7 days",
    execution: "timelock controlled",
    emergency: "guardian pause"
}
```

### Treasury Security

* 5-of-7 multi-sig
* Spending limits
* Transaction delays
* Audit trail
* Regular reporting

> 💰 **Economics**: Check [Token Economics](01-tokenomics.md) for treasury management.

## Operational Security

### Infrastructure

* Distributed validators
* Redundant systems
* DDoS protection
* Regular backups
* Monitoring systems

### Access Management

| Role      | Access Level | Requirements       |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Admin     | Full         | Multi-sig (5/7)    |
| Operator  | Limited      | 2FA + Hardware Key |
| Validator | Specific     | Staked + Verified  |
| User      | Basic        | Wallet Connection  |

### Monitoring & Alerts

* 24/7 network monitoring
* Automated alerts
* Performance metrics
* Security events
* Validator health

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories

1. **Smart Contract Risk**
   * Code vulnerabilities
   * Logic errors
   * Upgrade failures
   * Integration issues
2. **Economic Risk**
   * Token volatility
   * Liquidity issues
   * Market manipulation
   * Flash loan attacks
3. **Operational Risk**
   * Infrastructure failure
   * Human error
   * Social engineering
   * Data loss
4. **Regulatory Risk**
   * Compliance issues
   * Legal changes
   * Jurisdiction conflicts
   * Reporting requirements

### Mitigation Strategies

```typescript
interface RiskMitigation {
    technical: [
        "Regular audits",
        "Penetration testing",
        "Bug bounties",
        "Code reviews"
    ],
    economic: [
        "Value caps",
        "Rate limits",
        "Circuit breakers",
        "Insurance funds"
    ],
    operational: [
        "Team training",
        "Process documentation",
        "Incident response",
        "Disaster recovery"
    ]
}
```

> 🎯 **Planning**: See [Risk Management](../technical/06-risk-management.md) for detailed strategies.
